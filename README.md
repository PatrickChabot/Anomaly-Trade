I have completed setup for all three componenets and connected them.
Everything is still locally hosted.

Frontend - React 
Backend - Springboot
Database - PostgresSQL

All three servers must be running for the application to work locally.

Only functionality currently working is JWT token authorization VIA springboot, and Google's Oauth.
